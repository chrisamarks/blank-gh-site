  <h1>Area Cat pisses on freshly washed sheets to remind owner who’s really in charge</h1>
  <div>
      <p>San Jose, CA&mdash; Asserting his dominance over his subservient owner, 5 year old cat Tom pissed on owner Jeff&rsquo;s freshly washed sheets to remind him who&rsquo;s really in charge. &ldquo;I felt like Jeff was getting too big for his boots&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;It was a harsh, but ultimately fair decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting that this isn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;s had to resort to such drastic measures, Tom told reporters that recent behaviour by Jeff warranted this course of action. &ldquo;He had stopped petting me whenever I asked, and sometimes made me wait 10 minutes longer than usual for dinner&rdquo; Tom told reporters, &ldquo;Unacceptable. I just couldn&rsquo;t let that behaviour continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sources confirm that Tom met up with his pals Callie, Peanut, and Bongo to run the decision by them before going through with it. &ldquo;We all acknowledged how hurtful it would be to to pee on Jeff&rsquo;s freshly washed sheets, especially since he had a date planned for that night&rdquo; Bongo told reporters, &ldquo;But when we found out Jeff had moved Tom off of Jeff&rsquo;s laptop into his kitty bed 3 times last week, we agreed it was the right call.&rdquo; Peanut told reporters that he was stunned and outraged that Jeff would do such a thing, and questioned whether Jeff realised how warm and snuggly a laptop is to a little kitty. &ldquo;I get a hairball just thinking about it&rdquo; Callie said.</p>
<p>As he googled local animal shelters, Jeff told reporters that he thought Tom and he were on the same page. &ldquo;He be a cute snuggly kitty, and I house, feed, and occasionally clothe him&rdquo; Jeff said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d do this. All cats are the same.&rdquo; At press time, Jeff was observed placing a cucumber next to Tom and recording his reaction to post on YouTube.</p>
