      <p>Crowded, public place&mdash; Haha yeah, definitely. Well, I guess that&rsquo;s just the way it is, you know? I mean, there&rsquo;s not that much you can do about it, but it sounds like you&rsquo;re doing your best. Yeah haha that&rsquo;s all you can hope for. Sorry, what? Haha oh. Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm, I definitely understand where you&rsquo;re coming from, that makes a lot of sense. A similar thing happened to me once and honestly the best advice I can give you is to just stick with it. Wait, what? Oh, are we talking about the same thing? Wait a minute, what do you mean? Could you speak up?</p>
<p>Come again? Sorry, I can&rsquo;t hear you. Oh. Yeah. Well yeah mhm. Oh okay. Yeah. Sorry? Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah. What? I&rsquo;m really sorry to ask this again, but could you speak up? I&rsquo;m having trouble understanding what you&rsquo;re saying. Wait, what did you just say? Wait a minute, what the fuck? Are you serious? Wow, that&rsquo;s outrageous. No. No, stop. Wow. I totally had the wrong idea of what you were saying. No, I don&rsquo;t agree. Sorry? Oh. Oh. Yeah, sorry, um, you&rsquo;re right. Yeah. Okay. My bad. Good talk.</p>
