  <h1>California weatherman completely out of his depth at new job in the UK</h1>
  <div>
      <p>London, United Kingdom&mdash; Having crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a recent monumental career move, 34 year old ex-California weatherman Jimmy Melville is starting to realise that he is completely out of his depth reporting on the UK weather. &ldquo;In California, there are two seasons: won&rsquo;t rain and might rain&rdquo; Melville told reporters, &ldquo;In the UK, you can have a light showers, beautiful sunshine, and hellfire within 15 minutes of each other. How am I expected to accurately predict that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locals claim that the changeable weather makes day to day life a little more exciting, but Melville says it it&rsquo;s makes him feel like he&rsquo;ll never predict any weather pattern ever again. &ldquo;I feel like a macroeconomist&mdash; I can&rsquo;t predict shit!&rdquo; an exasperated and easy-target-picking Melville said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all well and good telling people it&rsquo;s raining once it&rsquo;s already started raining. They already know. Everyone knows! We all know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other than reporting on the weather, Melville has found the linguistic gap particularly challenging. He told reporters that half the time he doesn&rsquo;t even understand what people are saying. &ldquo;Why do people keep asking if I&rsquo;m alright? Do I not look alright?&rdquo; a disheveled Melville told reporters &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not alright. It rains every day I say it isn&rsquo;t going to, alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suffering from imposter syndrome, Melville told reporters that he feels that &ldquo;all his years spent in meteorology school were a complete waste&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;feels like a complete fraud.&rdquo; At press time, Melville hedged his bets by predicting that it will probably rain every day for the next year, informing reporters that &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t, people will be so happy it&rsquo;s sunny they&rsquo;ll forget I&rsquo;m full of shit.&rdquo;</p>
