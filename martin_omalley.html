  <h1>“I did my best” Martin O’Malley sobs to himself in the shower</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Des Moines, Iowa&mdash; After receiving just .6% of the vote in the Iowa Caucus, former Maryland governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley reportedly gave himself a pep talk amidst sobs during his post-result shower. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still young. I have time&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley comforted himself, &ldquo;I mean, Obama was elected when he was 47, but that&rsquo;s okay! That&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Admitting that he wouldn&rsquo;t be so devastated if he hadn&rsquo;t kept his expectations so high, O&rsquo;Malley feels he&rsquo;s been delusional over the past few months. &ldquo;I mean, should I be surprised?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley said to himself amidst tears, &ldquo;One guy showed up to my rally in Iowa. One!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Sources confirm hearing O&rsquo;Malley justify his failure of a presidential run by reminding himself of previous successful campaigns. &ldquo;You know, this is just a roadblock in my career&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley said, wiping his eyes, &ldquo;I was a great mayor and better governor.&rdquo; At press time, the temperature in O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s shower reportedly spiked, scalding him while he already &ldquo;felt the Bern.&rdquo;</p>
