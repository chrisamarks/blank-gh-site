  <h1>"Absolute legend" forces struggling single father to clean puke out of cab</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Coventry, United Kingdom&mdash; Sources confirm that 2nd year Politics student and local legend Eddie Winchester&nbsp;went on a complete bender last Friday night, culminating in him throwing up in a taxi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so wankered in my life,&rdquo; Eddie&nbsp;says &ldquo;One second I was dancing to Sorry by Justin Bieber after slamming 6 vodka redbulls at Smack, the next I had inconsiderately ruined the night and subsequent week for a single father of 2 struggling to make ends meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie&nbsp;confirmed that this was the last straw for the homesick immigrant taxi driver who left his home country for greater economic opportunities. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a fully grown man cry like that before&rdquo; noted the legend himself &ldquo;It was hilarious. Haha I was so drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Witnesses reported watching the teary-eyed man, who grew up without ready access to higher education, wipe Eddie's&nbsp;sick off the backseat for 45 minutes before returning to Smack where students refused to get in his cab because it smelled of sick. &ldquo;He said I had to pay a cleaning fee to make up for his lost business&rdquo; Eddie&nbsp;told reporters &ldquo;But I yelled &lsquo;fuck that for a laugh&rsquo; in his disheveled mug and ran off. Top quality bants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Local sources reported that after the taxi driver dropped his kids off at school the next morning, he went home and slammed a fifth of vodka alone in his bathroom. Looks like Eddie's&nbsp;legendaryness is contagious!</p>
