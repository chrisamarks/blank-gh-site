  <h1>Group member finds getting full credit for assignment he contributed nothing to unfair</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Coventry, United Kingdom&mdash; Having not read a single word of the assignment, 19 year old group member Tom Wesley feels that getting full credit for the Econometrics assignment he contributed nothing to is unfair. &ldquo;Honestly, I probably contributed less than nothing because of all my interjections&rdquo; Wesley told reporters, &ldquo;It may have seemed like I was trying to understand the assignment, but I was really just looking for people to laugh at my jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questioning his contribution to the group project, Wesley told reporters that it&rsquo;s not like he was completely silent during their group meetings. &ldquo;I mean sure, I threw in the occasional &lsquo;we&rsquo;re so fucked&rsquo; and &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t we just drop out and become strippers&rsquo;, but is that really contributing?&rdquo; Wesley said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wesley told reporters that he isn&rsquo;t trying to be a dick, he just wishes his group mates would look at it from his perspective. &ldquo;I mean, how would these guys feel if they contributed nothing to a project and still got full credit?&rdquo; Wesley said, &ldquo;It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. It&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be fair to Tom, he did do absolutely nothing&rdquo; Marc Stevens, one of Wesley&rsquo;s group mates told reporters, &ldquo;We all think he shouldn&rsquo;t receive the same grade as us, since we actually did the work, you know?&rdquo; At press time, Wesley&rsquo;s group mates were observed conspiring to blast Wesley as hard as possible in the group evaluation.</p>
