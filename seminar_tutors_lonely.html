  <h1>Report: 87% of seminar tutors incredibly lonely</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Coventry, United Kingdom&mdash; A recent Gallup Poll has depressing results for those looking to pursue a PhD in a subject they love: roughly 87% of seminar tutors are cripplingly lonely, largely due to lack of student participation. &ldquo;I mean, at least say that you don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;m here to teach you!&rdquo; said Lawrence Waite, a Computer Science PhD candidate &ldquo;Talk to me! God. I&rsquo;m so alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over 57% of seminar tutors look inwards, placing the lack of student participation on their own shortcomings. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t they talk to me? Is it my teaching style? I&rsquo;m dedicating my entire life to this and I can&rsquo;t get a single word out of these kids&rdquo; stressed&nbsp;Jorge Morales, a Development Economics PhD candidate &ldquo;It makes me feel like a complete failure. And so, so lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While some look inwards, others argue that the lack of student participation is due to the destructive culture surrounding participation in seminars. &ldquo;If you participate and say the right thing, you come off as overly keen. If you participate and say the wrong thing, you come off as overly keen and stupid&rdquo; explained Annabelle Clemenceau, a War History PhD candidate &ldquo;Bunch of pussies. Speak up! Please! Please talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digging deeper, Gallup reached out to the students of the seminar tutors surveyed, and the results were shocking: 67% never do the seminar work, 73% feel too hungover from the previous night to participate, and over 92% couldn&rsquo;t even spell their seminar tutor&rsquo;s last name.</p>
<p>When asked to comment on how it feels knowing that the kids you&rsquo;re teaching don&rsquo;t even care enough to know your name, over 23% of those polled yelled &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I&rsquo;m done caring!&rdquo; with tears in their eyes, and over 42% were on their phone, waiting for the interview to end.</p>
