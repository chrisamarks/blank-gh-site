  <h1>Area student really passionate about latest tech media buzzword</h1>
  <div>
      <p>London, United Kingdom&mdash; Emphatically stating how Blockchain technology is going to disrupt the way we buy cereal, 3rd year Economics student James&nbsp;Wilson can&rsquo;t contain his excitement for how the latest tech media buzzword is going to radically transform the world. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been this excited since I first learned about the Internet of People&rdquo; Wilson&nbsp;said, &ldquo;Can you imagine how cool that will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard about Ethereum?&rdquo; Wilson&nbsp;asked uninterested passersby, &ldquo;Think Blockchain 2.0, but with the power to replace lawyers and bankers. Through software!&rdquo; When we asked Wilson&nbsp;about his thoughts on recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence as heavily covered in publications like TechCrunch and Business Insider, he responded by saying &ldquo;Dude don&rsquo;t even get me started. That shit is so fucking cool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took a year out from uni to work at a FinTech / PropTech / TechDeck company, which was made even better by the tech media overstating the potential impact these kind of companies will have on society&rdquo; said Wilson. At press time, Wilson&nbsp;was reportedly meeting with VC firms seeking investment in his new venture; a company that sells software as a service, as a service.</p>
