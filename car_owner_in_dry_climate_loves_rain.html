  <h1>“I love the rain!” says car owner from climate where it doesn’t rain</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Palo Alto, CA&mdash; A self-declared pluviophile, 26 year old Susie Thompson says she enjoys nothing more than the tranquil serenity of a rainy day from the comfort of her dry, heated car in a climate where it very rarely rains. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just something so majestic and romantic about the rain,&rdquo; says Thompson &ldquo;Mostly because I don&rsquo;t have to take public transportation or be outside at all to get to work, and it pretty much never rains where I live anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thompson is a software engineer who spends probably around 5-10 minutes outside of a building on any given day, so the weather has very little influence on her actual day to day life. &ldquo;I love the idea of getting caught in the rain,&rdquo; she says &ldquo;when it does rain, which is incredibly rare, I never bring an umbrella or raincoat, half because I don&rsquo;t mind getting wet, half because it makes very little sense to own an umbrella or raincoat where I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thompson told reporters that as a kid, she &ldquo;enjoyed pretending that raindrops on the windshield of her family car were racing each other.&rdquo; Now, as an adult car owner, she finds that rainy days make her nostalgic as she drives to work in a dry, climate controlled vehicle that mitigates any effect the outside weather might have on her.</p>
<p>Having never experienced a serious flood in her life, Thompson confirmed that &ldquo;falling asleep to the pitter patter of rain drops on her bedroom windows is one of her absolute favourite things.&rdquo; She also remarked that she &ldquo;thinks people who dislike the rain are just being negative. There&rsquo;s so much to celebrate!&rdquo; Local homeless man Jake Bernal was unavailable for comment, but previous reports indicate that inclement weather &ldquo;really fucks up his whole day.&rdquo;</p>
