        <div>Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the potential to do a lot of good for the world. Extending beyond the achievements of DeepMind to beat the world's Go Champion in March last year, it is currently playing a role in improving the fairness of the insurance industry through companies like Lemonade, improving primary health care treatment through companies like Remedy, and making it possible to live in a future where we have self-driving cars, smart AI assistants, and highly-detailed personalised education for our kids. It is also being used in ways we don't necessarily notice or understand; curating our news feeds on Facebook, suggesting new music to us on Spotify, and profiling us for crimes we have yet to commit. On the flip side, AI researchers have been discussing the threat of the singularity, where AI could surpass humans as the most intellectually sophisticated entities on the planet. Regardless of its final applications, it is critical to encourage the union of the worlds of the computer scientists and machine learning experts and the humanities; specifically lawmakers, sociologists, psychologists, economists, philosophers, anthropologists, ethicists, and more. There needs to exist an interdisciplinary approach to creating regulatory frameworks so that we can ensure AI is leveraged to benefit humanity, rather than as a means of control.

        <div>Blockchain technology has been a hot topic in the finance world for the past year. In order to keep abreast of current trends in the financial services industry, it is critical to understand how the technology works, who the big players in this new industry are, and how this new implementation is at odds with the technology’s original culture.

        <div>Gamification is the application of game mechanics and game design techniques in non-game contexts. It is usually applied as a means of increasing customer engagement with services and encouraging beneficial societal behaviour by governments. In its very simplest form, it is an online marketing technique that uses elements of games like badges, points, and leaderboards to motivate people to engage with a service. The first example of the term comes from Professor Richard Bartle of the University of Essex in 1980, but it has become popularised over the past 6 years through its application in mobile applications and on the web. Kevin Werbach, professor at the Wharton School of Business and co-author of “For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business”, released a free MOOC in Gamification on Coursera in 2013 in order to explain the theory and history of Gamification in conjunction with its real world applications. Gamification has received some criticism, notably in an article published in The Atlantic titled ‘Gamification Is Bullshit’, but its roots are grounded in psychology, management, and mechanism design theory. Werbach notes that Gamification is very challenging to successfully implement without it coming off as gimmicky. Nonetheless, its application has been successful in increasing customer engagement, employee engagement, and promoting social good.
