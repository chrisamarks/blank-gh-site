  <h1>Carson hurt by Cruz’ joke about him being a bad surgeon</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Des Moines, Iowa&mdash; During last night&rsquo;s GOP debate, Ted Cruz imitated Donald Trump by calling all of the GOP candidates stupid, fat, and ugly and Carson a terrible surgeon, which really hurt Carson&rsquo;s feelings. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it when Cruz pretends to bully me. I can&rsquo;t tell if people are laughing at Trump or me&rdquo; Carson told reporters, &ldquo;It hurts more. I miss Trump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting that Cruz should be careful about what he says given Carson&rsquo;s childhood, Carson told reporters that he thinks Cruz &ldquo;should probably watch out, I mean, everyone knows about that time I tried to stab that guy&rdquo; Carson said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m high energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling particularly singled out by Cruz&rsquo; mockery, Carson thinks that Cruz does not respect him as a candidate in this upcoming election. &ldquo;I mean, what does he think I am? A one horse country?&rdquo; Carson reportedly said. At press time, Carson was observed yelling &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got gifted hands. Gifted hands!&rdquo; at passersby outside of the Iowa Events Center.</p>
