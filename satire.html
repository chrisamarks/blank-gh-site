          Des Moines, Iowa&mdash; After receiving just .6% of the vote in the Iowa Caucus, former Maryland governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley reportedly gave himself a pep talk amidst sobs during his post-result shower. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still young. I have time&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley comforted himself, &ldquo;I mean, Obama was elected when he was 47, but that&rsquo;s okay! That&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo;

          Coventry, United Kingdom&mdash; Warning students that failing to understand what was covered last week will lead them to fail their degrees, 54 year old Law professor George Jenkins consistently overstates the difficulty of the content of his lectures. &ldquo;That was the easiest iteration of the concept&rdquo; said Jenkins, &ldquo;So if you found that difficult, you&rsquo;re really, really fucked.&rdquo;

          Des Moines, Iowa&mdash; During last night&rsquo;s GOP debate, Ted Cruz imitated Donald Trump by calling all of the GOP candidates stupid, fat, and ugly and Carson a terrible surgeon, which really hurt Carson&rsquo;s feelings. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it when Cruz pretends to bully me. I can&rsquo;t tell if people are laughing at Trump or me&rdquo; Carson told reporters, &ldquo;It hurts more. I miss Trump.&rdquo;
